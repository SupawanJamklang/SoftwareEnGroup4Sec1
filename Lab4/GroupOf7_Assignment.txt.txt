                                       The Emperor's New Clothes by Hans Christian Andersen

Many years ago, there was an Emperor, who was so excessively fond of new clothes, that he
spent all his money in dress. He did not trouble himself in the least about his soldiers; nor did
he care to go either to the theatre or the chase, except for the opportunities then afforded him
for displaying his new clothes. He had a different suit for each hour of the day; and as of any
other king or emperor, one is accustomed to say, "he is sitting in council," it was always said of
him, "The Emperor is sitting in his wardrobe."
Time passed merrily in the large town which was his capital; strangers arrived every day at the
court. One day, two rogues, calling themselves weavers, made their appearance. They gave out
that they knew how to weave stuffs of the most beautiful colors and elaborate patterns, the
clothes manufactured from which should have the wonderful property of remaining invisible to
everyone who was unfit for the office he held, or who was extraordinarily simple in character.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"These must, indeed, be splendid clothes!" thought the Emperor. "Had I such a suit, I might at
once find out what men in my realms are unfit for their office, and also be able to distinguish
the wise from the foolish! This stuff must be woven for me immediately." And he caused large
sums of money to be given to both the weavers in order that they might begin their work
directly.
So the two pretended weavers set up two looms, and affected to work very busily, though in
reality they did nothing at all. They asked for the most delicate silk and the purest gold thread;
put both into their own knapsacks; and then continued their pretended work at the empty
looms until late at night.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"I should like to know how the weavers are getting on with my cloth," said the Emperor to
himself, after some little time had elapsed; he was, however, rather embarrassed, when he
remembered that a simpleton, or one unfit for his office, would be unable to see the
manufacture. To be sure, he thought he had nothing to risk in his own person; but yet, he
would prefer sending somebody else, to bring him intelligence about the weavers, and their
work, before he troubled himself in the affair. All the people throughout the city had heard of
the wonderful property the cloth was to possess; and all were anxious to learn how wise, or
how ignorant, their neighbors might prove to be.
"I will send my faithful old minister to the weavers," said the Emperor at last, after some
deliberation, "he will be best able to see how the cloth looks; for he is a man of sense, and no
one can be more suitable for his office than he is."
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So the faithful old minister went into the hall, where the knaves were working with all their
might, at their empty looms. "What can be the meaning of this?" thought the old man, opening
his eyes very wide. "I cannot discover the least bit of thread on the looms." However, he did not
express his thoughts aloud.
The impostors requested him very courteously to be so good as to come nearer their looms;
and then asked him whether the design pleased him, and whether the colors were not very
beautiful; at the same time pointing to the empty frames. The poor old minister looked and
looked, he could not discover anything on the looms, for a very good reason, viz: there was
nothing there. "What!" thought he again. "Is it possible that I am a simpleton? I have never
thought so myself; and no one must know it now if I am so. Can it be, that I am unfit for my
office? No, that must not be said either. I will never confess that I could not see the stuff."
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Well, Sir Minister!" said one of the knaves, still pretending to work. "You do not say whether
the stuff pleases you."
"Oh, it is excellent!" replied the old minister, looking at the loom through his spectacles. "This
pattern, and the colors, yes, I will tell the Emperor without delay, how very beautiful I think
them."
